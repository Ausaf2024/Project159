    <p>The foundation of every website is a content management system (CMS). There are a number of different content management systems to choose from open-source platforms such as WordPress to beginner-friendly all-in-one website builders such as Shopify or Squarespace. Which is right for you and your online store will depend on your budget, experience, and unique e-commerce needs.

Here are the most popular content management systems for e-commerce websites:

WordPress: The world’s leading CMS that is also one of the most customizable.
Shopify: An ideal e-commerce solution for building a dropshipping business.
Squarespace: One of the best website builders for beginners who want to easily build a professional website with no previous web design experience.
Square Online: Best for existing retailers that are looking to sell in-person and online.
Wix: An all-in-one website builder that is both easy to use and highly customizable.</p>
    <p>The first thing you need to consider is a theme for your website. Themes are ready-made templates that give your website a consistent look and feel. All subscription platforms have tons of templates to choose from, so whether you’re building your e-commerce website with WordPress, Shopify, Wix or anything else, you will have prebuilt templates and themes to choose from.

Keep in mind that while free templates are generally available across most platforms, some also offer paid (or premium) templates. For example, both WordPress and Shopify offer premium themes that range in price from around $30 to over $200. The benefit is that many offer more unique designs, which can help businesses that want a specific look to reduce the amount of time spent customizing their chosen theme.
